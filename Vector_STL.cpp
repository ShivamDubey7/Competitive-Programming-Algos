//Vector 

begin() – Returns an iterator pointing to the first element in the vector
end() – Returns an iterator pointing to the theoretical element that follows the last element in the vector
rbegin() – Returns a reverse iterator pointing to the last element in the vector (reverse beginning). It moves from last to first element
rend() – Returns a reverse iterator pointing to the theoretical element preceding the first element in the vector (considered as reverse end)

Output:
Output of begin and end: 1 2 3 4 5 
Output of rbegin and rend: 5 4 3 2 1 

size() – Returns the number of elements in the vector.
max_size() – Returns the maximum number of elements that the vector can hold.
resize(n) – Resizes the container so that it contains ‘n’ elements.
empty() – Returns whether the container is empty.
shrink_to_fit() – Reduces the capacity of the container to fit its size and destroys all elements beyond the capacity.
reserve() – Requests that the vector capacity be at least enough to contain n elements.

    cout << "\nSize : " << g1.size();

reference operator [g] – Returns a reference to the element at position ‘g’ in the vector
at(g) – Returns a reference to the element at position ‘g’ in the vector
front() – Returns a reference to the first element in the vector
back() – Returns a reference to the last element in the vector

back() : g1.back() = 100

assign() – It assigns new value to the vector elements by replacing old ones
push_back() – It push the elements into a vector from the back
pop_back() – It is used to pop or remove elements from a vector from the back.
insert() – It inserts new elements before the element at the specified position
erase() – It is used to remove elements from a container from the specified position or range.
swap() – It is used to swap the contents of one vector with another vector of same type. Sizes may differ.
clear() – It is used to remove all the elements of the vector container
emplace() – It extends the container by inserting new element at position
emplace_back() – It is used to insert a new element into the vector container, the new element is added to the end of the vector
